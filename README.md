# "I-Will-Be-Back"

It's a Fall back for my Heroku Apps (in production) when they cosume their free monthly hours.

## What is it?

When my Apps running on Heroku servers consume their free monthly dyno hours, any user of those Apps will be "redirected" to I-Will-Be-Back App till the monthly hours are renewed.
